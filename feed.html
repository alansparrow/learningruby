<p>I'm not in Ruby core or, well, even a confident C coder anymore, but I've long enjoyed digging in the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby">Ruby MRI source code</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IX1NfwQP1s">understand weird behavior</a> and to pick up stuff for my <a href="https://cooperpress.com/rubyreloaded">Ruby course.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/">Pat Shaughnessy</a> is also a fan of digging around in Ruby's internals and has written some great posts like <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/6/29/how-ruby-executes-your-code">How Ruby Executes Your Code</a>, <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/7/26/objects-classes-and-modules">Objects, Classes and Modules</a>, and <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/4/3/exploring-rubys-regular-expression-algorithm">Exploring Ruby's Regular Expression Algorithm.</a></p>
<p>When Pat released his <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope">Ruby Under a Microscope</a> book, I knew it would be right up my street! He digs into how objects are represented internally, why MRI, Rubinius and JRuby act in certain ways and, of course, "lots more."</p>
<p>I invited Pat to take a very high level cruise through the MRI codebase with me so we could share that knowledge with Ruby programmers who haven't dared take a look 'under the hood' and to show it's not as scary or pointless as it may seem. <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-mri-code-walk-tour-6020.html" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>
