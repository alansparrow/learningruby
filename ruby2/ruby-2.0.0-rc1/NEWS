      * respond_to? against a protected method now returns false unless
        the second argument is true.
      * __callee__ has returned to the original behavior, and now
        returns the called name but not the original name in an
        aliased method.
      * Kernel#inspect does not call #to_s anymore
        (it used to call redefined #to_s).

  * LoadError
    * added method:
      * added LoadError#path method to return the file name that could not be
        loaded.

  * Module
    * added method:
      * added Module#prepend which is similar to Module#include,
        however a method in the prepended module overrides the
        corresponding method in the prepending module.
      * added Module#refine, which extends a class or module locally.

  * NilClass
    * added method:
      * added nil.to_h which returns {}

  * Process

      * added Range#bsearch for binary search.

  * RubyVM (MRI specific)
    * added Environment variables to specify stack usage:
      * RUBY_THREAD_VM_STACK_SIZE: vm stack size used at thread creation.
        default: 128KB (32bit CPU) or 256KB (64bit CPU).
      * RUBY_THREAD_MACHINE_STACK_SIZE: machine stack size used at thread
        creation. default: 512KB or 1024KB.

    * added constant DEFAULT_PARAMS to get above default parameters.

  * Signal
    * added method:
      * added Signal.signame which returns signal name

    * incompatible changes:
      * Signal.trap raises ArgumentError when :SEGV, :BUS, :ILL, :FPE, :VTALRM
        are specified.

  * String
    * added method:
      * added String#b returning a copied string whose encoding is ASCII-8BIT.
    * change return value:
      * String#lines now returns an array instead of an enumerator.
      * String#chars now returns an array instead of an enumerator.
      * String#codepoints now returns an array instead of an enumerator.
      * String#bytes now returns an array instead of an enumerator.

  * Struct
    * added method:
      * added Struct#to_h returning values with keys corresponding to the
        instance variable names.

  * Thread
    * added method:
      * added Thread#thread_variable_get for getting thread local variables
        (these are different than Fiber local variables).
      * added Thread#thread_variable_set for setting thread local variables.
      * added Thread#thread_variables for getting a list of the thread local
        variable keys.
      * added Thread#thread_variable? for testing to see if a particular thread
        variable has been set.
      * added Thread#backtrace_locations which returns similar information of
        Kernel#caller_locations.
    * incompatible changes:
      * Thread#join and Thread#value now raises a ThreadError if target thread
        is the current or main thread.

  * Time
    * change return value:
      * Time#to_s returned encoding defaults to US-ASCII but automatically
        transcodes to Encoding.default_internal if it is set.

  * TracePoint
    * new class. This class is replacement of set_trace_func.
      Easy to use and efficient implementation.

  * toplevel
    * added method:
      * added main.define_method which defines a global function.
      * added main.using, which imports refinements into the current file or
        eval string. [experimental]

* cgi
  * Add HTML5 tag maker.
  * CGI#header has been renamed to CGI#http_header and
    aliased to CGI#header.
  * When HTML5 tagmaker called, overwrite CGI#header,
    CGI#header function is to create a <header> element.

* iconv
  * Iconv has been removed. Use String#encode instead.

* io/wait
  * new features:
    * added IO#wait_writable method.
    * added IO#wait_readable method as alias of IO#wait.

* net/http
  * new features:
    * Proxies are now automatically detected from the http_proxy environment
      variable.  See Net::HTTP::new for details.
    * gzip and deflate compression are now requested for all requests by
      default.  See Net::HTTP for details.
    * SSL sessions are now reused across connections for a single instance.
      This speeds up connection by using a previously negotiated session.
    * Requests may be created from a URI which sets the request_uri and host
      header of the request (but does not change the host connected to).
    * Responses contain the URI requested which allows easier implementation of
      redirect following.
  * new methods:
    * Net::HTTP#local_host
    * Net::HTTP#local_host=
    * Net::HTTP#local_port
    * Net::HTTP#local_port=
  * extended method:
    * Net::HTTP#connect uses local_host and local_port if specified.

* net/imap
  * new methods:
    * Net::IMAP.default_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_imap_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_tls_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_ssl_port
    * Net::IMAP.default_imaps_port

* objspace
  * new method:
    * ObjectSpace.reachable_objects_from(obj)

* openssl
  * Consistently raise an error when trying to encode nil values. All instances
    of OpenSSL::ASN1::Primitive now raise TypeError when calling to_der on an
    instance whose value is nil. All instances of OpenSSL::ASN1::Constructive
    raise NoMethodError in the same case. Constructing such values is still
    permitted.
  * TLS 1.1 & 1.2 support by setting OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#ssl_version to
    :TLSv1_2, :TLSv1_2_server, :TLSv1_2_client or :TLSv1_1, :TLSv1_1_server
    :TLSv1_1_client. The version being effectively used can be queried
    with OpenSSL::SSL#ssl_version. Furthermore, it is also possible to
    blacklist the new TLS versions with OpenSSL::SSL:OP_NO_TLSv1_1 and
    OpenSSL::SSL::OP_NO_TLSv1_2.
  * Added OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#renegotiation_cb. A user-defined callback
    may be set which gets called whenever a new handshake is negotiated. This
    also allows to programmatically decline (client) renegotiation attempts.
  * Support for "0/n" splitting of records as BEAST mitigation via
    OpenSSL::SSL::OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS.
  * The default options for OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext have changed to
    OpenSSL::SSL::OP_ALL & ~OpenSSL::SSL::OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS
    instead of OpenSSL::SSL::OP_ALL only. This enables the countermeasure for
    the BEAST attack by default.
  * OpenSSL requires passwords for decrypting PEM-encoded files to be at least
    four characters long. This led to awkward situations where an export with
    a password with fewer than four characters was possible, but accessing the
    file afterwards failed. OpenSSL::PKey::RSA, OpenSSL::PKey::DSA and
    OpenSSL::PKey::EC therefore now enforce the same check when exporting a
    private key to PEM with a password - it has to be at least four characters
    long.
  * SSL/TLS support for the Next Protocol Negotiation extension. Supported
    with OpenSSL 1.0.1 and higher.
  * OpenSSL::OPENSSL_FIPS allows client applications to detect whether OpenSSL
    is FIPS-enabled. OpenSSL.fips_mode= allows turning on and off FIPS mode
    manually in order to adapt to situations where FIPS mode would be an
    explicit requirement.
  * Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) is supported via
    Cipher#auth_data= and Cipher#auth_tag/Cipher#auth_tag=. 
    Currently (OpenSSL 1.0.1c), only GCM mode is supported.

* ostruct
  * new methods:
    * OpenStruct#[], []=
    * OpenStruct#each_pair
    * OpenStruct#eql?
    * OpenStruct#hash
    * OpenStruct#to_h converts the struct to a hash.
  * extended method:
    * OpenStruct.new also accepts an OpenStruct / Struct.

* pathname
  * extended method:
    * Pathname#find returns an enumerator if no block is given.

* rake
  * rake has been updated to version 0.9.5.

    This version is backwards-compatible with previous rake versions and
    contains many bug fixes.

    See
    http://rake.rubyforge.org/doc/release_notes/rake-0_9_5_rdoc.html for a list
    of changes in rake 0.9.3, 0.9.4 and 0.9.5.

* rdoc
  * rdoc has been updated to version 4.0

    This version is largely backwards-compatible with previous rdoc versions.
    The most notable change is an update to the ri data format (ri data must
    be regenerated for gems shared across rdoc versions).  Further API changes
    are internal and won't affect most users.

    See https://github.com/rdoc/rdoc/blob/master/History.rdoc for a list of
    changes in rdoc 4.0.

* resolv
  * new methods:
    * Resolv::DNS#timeouts=
    * Resolv::DNS::Config#timeouts=

* rexml
  * REXML::Document#write supports Hash arguments.
  * REXML::Document#write supports new :encoding option. It changes
    XML document encoding. Without :encoding option, encoding in
    XML declaration is used for XML document encoding.

* RubyGems
  * Updated to 2.0.0.preview2

    RubyGems 2.0.0 features the following improvements:

    * Improved support for default gems shipping with ruby 2.0.0+
    * A gem can have arbitrary metadata through Gem::Specification#metadata
    * `gem search` now defaults to --remote and is anchored like gem list.
    * Added --document to replace --rdoc and --ri.  Use --no-document to
      disable documentation, --document=rdoc to only generate rdoc.
    * Only ri-format documentation is generated by default.
    * `gem server` uses RDoc::Servlet from RDoc 4.0 to generate HTML
      documentation.

    For an expanded list of updates and bug fixes see:
    https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/History.txt

* shellwords
    * Shellwords#shellescape() now stringifies the given object using to_s.
    * Shellwords#shelljoin() accepts non-string objects in the given
      array, each of which is stringified using to_s.

* stringio
  * deprecated methods:
    * StringIO#lines, #bytes, #chars and #codepoints are deprecated.

* syslog
  * Added Syslog::Logger which provides a Logger API atop Syslog.
  * Syslog::Priority, Syslog::Level, Syslog::Option and Syslog::Macros
    are introduced for easy detection of available constants on a
    running system.

* tmpdir
  * incompatible changes:
    * Dir.mktmpdir uses FileUtils.remove_entry instead of
      FileUtils.remove_entry_secure.  This means that applications should not
      change the permission of the created temporary directory to make
      accessible from other users.

* yaml
  * Syck has been removed.  YAML now completely depends on libyaml being
    installed.

* zlib
  * Added streaming support for Zlib::Inflate and Zlib::Deflate.  This allows
    processing of a stream without the use of large amounts of memory.
  * Added support for the new deflate strategies Zlib::RLE and Zlib::FIXED.
  * Zlib streams are now processed without the GVL.  This allows gzip, zlib and
    deflate streams to be processed in parallel.
  * deprecated methods:
    * Zlib::GzipReader#lines and #bytes are deprecated.

=== Language changes

  * Added %i and %I for symbol list creation (similar to %w and %W).

  * Default source encoding is changed to UTF-8. (was US-ASCII)

=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

  * Array#values_at

    See above.

  * String#lines
  * String#chars
  * String#codepoints
  * String#bytes

    These methods no longer return an Enumerator, although passing a
    block is still supported for backwards compatibility.

    Code like str.lines.with_index(1) { |line, lineno| ... } no longer
    works because str.lines returns an array.  Replace lines with
    each_line in such cases.

  * IO#lines
  * IO#chars
  * IO#codepoints
  * IO#bytes
  * ARGF#lines
  * ARGF#chars
  * ARGF#codepoints
  * ARGF#bytes
  * StringIO#lines
  * StringIO#chars
  * StringIO#codepoints
  * StringIO#bytes
  * Zlib::GzipReader#lines
  * Zlib::GzipReader#bytes

    These methods are deprecated in favor of each_line, each_byte,
    each_char and each_codepoint.

  * Signal.trap

    See above.

  * Merge Onigmo.
    https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo

  * The :close_others option is true by default for system() and exec().
    Also, the close-on-exec flag is set by default for all new file descriptors.
    This means file descriptors doesn't inherit to spawned process unless
    explicitly requested such as system(..., fd=>fd).

  * Kernel#respond_to? against a protected method now returns false
    unless the second argument is true.

  * Dir.mktmpdir in lib/tmpdir.rb

    See above.

  * OpenStruct new methods can conflict with custom attributes named
    "each_pair", "eql?", "hash" or "to_h".

  * Thread#join, Thread#value

    See above.

  * Mutex#lock, Mutex#unlock, Mutex#try_lock, Mutex#synchronize and Mutex#sleep

    See above.
