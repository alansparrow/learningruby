<p>Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it
will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no
fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or
small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and
date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no
possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all
events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this
chapter.</p>

<p>For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble,
by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether
the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is
somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared;
or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would
have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful
specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country.</p>

<p>Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse,
is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly
befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it
was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have
occurred.  The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing
Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,–a troublesome
practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy
existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress,
rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being
decidedly in favour of the latter.  Now, if, during this brief period,
Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts,
experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most
inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time.  There being nobody
by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an
unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by
contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them.  The result
was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded
to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden
having been imposed  upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could
reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed
of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time
than three minutes and a quarter.</p>

<p>As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs,
the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead,
rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow;
and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, ‘Let me see the child,
and die.’</p>

<p>The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving
the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately.  As the young woman
spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed’s head, said, with more kindness
than might have been expected of him:</p>

<p>‘Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.’</p>

<p>‘Lor bless her dear heart, no!’ interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in
her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting
in a corner with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and
had thirteen children of her own, and all on ’em dead except two, and them
in the wurkus with me, she’ll know better than to take on in that way,
bless her dear heart!  Think what it is to be a mother, there’s a dear
young lamb do.‘</p>

<p>Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother’s prospects failed in
producing its due effect.  The patient shook her head, and stretched out
her hand towards the child.</p>

<p>The surgeon deposited it in her arms.  She imprinted her cold white lips
passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly
round; shuddered; fell back–and died. They chafed her breast, hands, and
temples; but the blood had stopped forever.  They talked of hope and
comfort. They had been strangers too long.</p>

<p>‘It’s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!‘ said the surgeon at last.</p>

<p>‘Ah, poor dear, so it is!’ said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green
bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up the
child.  ‘Poor dear!’</p>

<p>‘You needn’t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,‘ said the
surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. ’It’s very likely
it <em>will</em> be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.‘  He put
on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door, added,
’She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?‘</p>

<p>‘She was brought here last night,’ replied the old woman, ‘by the
overseer’s order.  She was found lying in the street.  She had walked some
distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or
where she was going to, nobody knows.‘</p>

<p>The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand.  ‘The old
story,’ he said, shaking his head: ‘no wedding-ring, I see. Ah!
Good-night!’</p>

<p>The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once
more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before
the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.</p>

<p>What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was! 
Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he
might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been
hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in
society.  But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had
grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into
his place at once–a parish child–the orphan of a workhouse–the humble,
half-starved drudge–to be cuffed and buffeted through the world–despised by
all, and pitied by none.</p>

<p>Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan, left to
the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have
cried the louder.</p>
