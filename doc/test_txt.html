<p>Fast learning, malleable skills and social network as determinants of
business project’s implementation</p>

<p>Tran Nguyen Bao Trung South Korea, Seoul, Hanyang University, Department of
Computer Science &amp; Engineering Email: baotrungtn@me.com</p>

<p>Introduction:  In this era of globalization, everything goes fast and
changes fast; especially in doing business. Therefore, it requires every
organization to develop new set of skills which are suitable to this new
circumstance. In research about successful and innovative companies in the
world, I found out three critical skills which contribute to fast
development as well as great adaption of those companies; these skills are
the topic of this paper. The current paper focuses on organization
learning, malleable skills of managers as well as managers’ private social
network in the context of implementing a business project. I examine the
case that if an organization emphasizes on fast learning, whether their
absorptive capacity necessarily lead to combinative capacity or not. In
addition, I examine if malleable skills of an organization’s managers can
provide combinatory managerial skills and visionary leadership. Lastly, I
also study how important social network plays in C&amp;D (connecting &amp;
development) when a project has tight budget.  My dependent variable for
the first question is the ratio of company’s innovative products/company’s
granted patents. For the second question, I use the performance (revenue)
of a company which has managers who have experience in R&amp;D as well as
marketing. For the last question, I use the amount of money a company can
save if they use outside R&amp;D network. Keywords: organization learning,
malleable skill, social network, absorptive capacity, combinative capacity,
R&amp;D</p>

<p>Literature review Three schools of thought:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Organization learning:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>In Organizational development (OD), learning is a characteristic of an
adaptive organization, i.e., an organization that is able to sense changes
in signals from its environment (both internal and external) and adapt
accordingly. Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi (1995) developed a four stage spiral
model of organizational learning. They started by differentiating Polanyi’s
concept of “tacit knowledge” from “explicit knowledge” and describe a
process of alternating between the two. Tacit knowledge is personal,
context specific, subjective knowledge, whereas explicit knowledge is
codified, systematic, formal, and easy to communicate. The tacit knowledge
of key personnel within the organization can be made explicit, codified in
manuals, and incorporated into new products and processes. This process
they called “externalization”. The reverse process (from explicit to tacit)
they call “internalization” because it involves employees internalizing an
organization’s formal rules, procedures, and other forms of explicit
knowledge. They also use the term “socialization” to denote the sharing of
tacit knowledge, and the term “combination” to denote the dissemination of
codified knowledge. According to this model, knowledge creation and
organizational learning take a path of socialization, externalization,
combination, internalization, socialization, externalization, combination .
. . etc. in an infinite spiral.  Absorptive capacity was defined originally
as a firm’s ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate
it, and apply it for commercial purposes (Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990).
Since the original definition, various conceptualizations of absorptive
capacity have emerged (Lane et al., 2006 and Lev et al., 2009). While the
early conceptualizations focused on R&amp;D-issues, later research
broadened the concept to developing absorptive capacity at the
organisational level (Lichtenthaler, 2009 and Tsai, 2001).  Combinative
capabilities, which describe how a company systematises, socialises, and
coordinates knowledge (Zollo &amp; Winter, 2002). Systemising,
coordinating, and socialising knowledge can either contribute to or hinder
learning processes and the corresponding level of absorptive capacity
(Bosch et al., 1999). Coordinating knowledge refers to cross-functional
interfaces and participation in decision-processes. Knowledge can be
systematised by the formalisation and routinisation of organisational
actions. The socialisation of knowledge is based on the density of social
linkages (structural aspects) and shared social experience (cognitive
aspects) in an organisation, and between the organisation and its external
partners (customers, suppliers, and so on) (Bosch et al., 1999, Jansen et
al., 2005 and Kogut and Zander, 1992).</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Job rotation:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Job rotation is the movement of workers between different jobs. It requires
workers to move between different “jobs”, or more usually workstations,
usually at fixed times. Job enlargement increases the variety of tasks
built into the job, may involve taking on more duties and usually adds
variety to a person’s job. Teamwork involves the team in the planning and
allocation of the work. Each team member carries out a set of operations to
complete the product, allowing the worker to move between tasks. In the
book Eriksson &amp; Ortega (2004, p.1) tested three theories of why
organization introduce job rotation, “employee, employer learning, and
employee motivation.” With employee learning, the theory is “that employees
who rotate accumulate more human capital because they are exposed to wider
range of experiences. The more an employee moves, the more he learns”
(Eriksson &amp; Ortega, 2004, p.2). Under the employer learning theory,
“the firm itself learns more about its own employees if it can observe how
they perform at different jobs. To find the job that an employee is best
at, the employer needs to move the employee around and observe how he
performs at each position” (Eriksson &amp; Ortega, 2004, p.2). The employee
motivation theory states, job rotation “motivates employees who would
otherwise become bored and tired of always performing the same tasks”
(Eriksson &amp; Ortega 2004, p.2);</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Social capital and Social network:</p>
</li></ol>

<p>A social network is a theoretical construct useful in the social sciences
to study relationships between individuals, groups, organizations, or even
entire societies (social units, see differentiation) Everyone have social
capital when they experience any advantage because of their position in a
network. They will be provided information, knowledge, and opportunities
from their partners in their network, these benefits can be very useful to
their life. The networks of relationships (social networks) form basic
structures that social capital is produced. These structures consist of
nodes and ties. Nodes are people and ties are their relationship. There are
also weak tie and strong tie. Weak tie means distant relationship (rarely
contact) and strong tie represents close relationship (frequent
communication). Most social structures tend to be characterized by dense
clusters of strong connections (Burt, Ronald, 2004). Information within
these clusters tends to be rather homogeneous and redundant. Non-redundant
information is most often obtained through contacts in different clusters.
(Burt, Ronald, 1992). When two separate clusters possess non-redundant
information, there is said to be a structural hole between them. (Burt,
Ronald, 1992). Thus, a network that bridges structural holes will provide
network benefits that are in some degree additive, rather than overlapping.
An ideal network structure has a vine and cluster structure, providing
access to many different clusters and structural holes. (Burt, Ronald,
1992). Networks rich in structural holes are a form of social capital in
that they offer information benefits. The main player in a network that
bridges structural holes is able to access information from diverse sources
and clusters (Burt, Ronald, 1992). This is beneficial to an individual’s
career because he is more likely to hear of job openings and opportunities
if his network spans a wide range of contacts in different
industries/sectors. Discussion From the theory about organization learning,
we can see a close relationship between a company’s absorptive capacity and
its combinative capacity. Because the organization learning process must
follow the cycle of “socialization, externalization, combination,
internalization” it can be stated that absorptive capacity, or
internalization, has an impact on combination, or combinative capacity of a
company. It implies that if a company learns a lot of knowledge, it can
increase the chance to combine and apply that knowledge into real products.
However, the above process is applied in normal case. How about the case
when an organization is forced to learn fast? Can it still keep
“socialization, externalization, combination, internalization” cycle or it
has to drop some stages? In the search for the answer of this question, I
think of the learning of an organization from its employees’ learning. For
people, the learning capacity is not really related to creative capacity
(combinative capacity). This can be explained by Left Brain Right Brain
theory which states that each side of the brain controls different types of
thinking (Roger Wolcott Sperry, 1974). According to this theory, a person
who is “left-brained” is often said to be more logical, analytical, while a
person who is “right-brained” is said to be more thoughtful and creative.
Therefore, the combinative capacity or absorptive capacity of a person is
already decided separately by the structure of one’s brain; there is few
connection between them. I believe that if an organization wants to learn
fast, it must possess people who have excellent learning skills or
“left-brained”. In other meaning, the amount of “left-brained” employee
must be much more than the amount of “right-brained” ones. Therefore, fast
learning emphasized organization will absorb knowledge quickly but it is
not sure they can apply all of these knowledge. I give the case of Samsung,
the company which has excellent fast learning skills and Apple, the company
has excellent combinative skills.</p>

As can be seen in the table, although Apple has much less patent than
Samsung it created more innovative products than Samsung. This can be used
to prove Apple’s capacity in combining new knowledge. Another fact is that
Apple has a lot of employees who major related to Art and Samsung has a lot
of PhD in science and technology. By using job rotation theory, I can
examine relationship between the performance of an organization and its
managers’ experience. The job rotation theory shows that by changing
position a person can learn more about the operation of company because
she/he can experience various working environments as well as different
tasks. Also, through that process, she/he can finds out which position
she/he can perform best. Employer can know more about their employees in
the aspect of working attitude, performance, and feeling about company. In
detail for the case of managers, by applying job rotation policy, they can
understand the activities of other departments. These understandings also
include difficulties and constrains when they have to implement a task
which requires cooperation, acceptance from other departments. They also
have a chance to share their expertise experience, life experience, empathy
with new partners. This can build a more united organization, or make the
organization one. Moreover, a very critical meaning of job rotation is that
new ideas from different kinds of people, not only people in one
department, can provide creative solutions for any problems. And because of
the abundance of new ideas and knowledge, managers can have enough
information to decide what, when, why and how to do a project. In scope of
this paper, I have examined the performance of companies whose managers
have both experience in R&amp;D department and marketing department. The SK
Chemical case can show this relationship:</p>

<p>The period from 1999-2000 is the time when SK Chemical successfully
developed and deployed TRAST, a new patch medication. In the beginning,
this project faced a lot of difficulties. Those constrains were from the
marketing team which could not see the potential of new product whereas
R&amp;D team insisted on the advantage of their new product. Fortunately,
the knot finally opened by Mr. Wie-Jong Kwak, Vice President of SK Life
Science R&amp;D Center. Mr. Kwak has experience in both marketing and
R&amp;D sector, so with technological background he believed the success of
the new product; and by understanding disciplines in marketing, he also
successfully persuade marketing team.  Other companies I can point out are
IT companies like Microsoft, Facebook… These tech companies were all found
by technical people (almost all of them has Computer Science major). The
CEOs of these companies have also been proved that they possess very
excellent marketing skill via the sale of their companies. An example is
that when Bill Gates promises to IBM that Microsoft can provide the best
Operation System (OS) although at that time he did not make anything like
that. Then they bought the cheap OS from other and made it their own. He
also persuaded IBM to agree on licensing contract which turned to be a very
big success for Microsoft. So Bill Gates’ idea was a combination of idea
from a marketer and idea from an engineer. The graph is Microsoft’s stock
performance when they introduce Windows 98.</p>

<pre>By using the theory about Social Capital and Social Network, I examine if social network can help implement a project with tight budget. As the theory implies, everyone has their own social network, and it can be broad or narrow. People in a network interact with each other to gain benefit. The benefit here can be information, knowledge, opportunities or even another node in a different social network. Therefore, in the concept of resource, social network can be the source of various resources.</pre>

<p>Because to implement a project, a lot of conditions must be satisfied, it
is especially difficult for a project without a lot of money. There are a
lot of things to spend for like employee, facilities, raw materials… and to
develop new product, R&amp;D department is a must-have department. However,
unlike other investments, R&amp;D requires a lot of money to buy machines,
technology, hire researchers… and also it requires a relative period of
time to produce expected result-target of any R&amp;D center. To release
these difficulties, a more creative approaching method must be used. As I
mentioned above, because social network can be the source of other
resources, this is a suitable solution for the tight budget problem.
Instead of investing huge amount of money for R&amp;D, via social
networking, project leader can find exactly necessary knowledge and who can
provide that knowledge. In this case, project leader must have, instead of
financial capital, a huge amount of social capital or broad network. And
although social capital plays an important role, the way a project leader
uses his social capital is more critical. With a good understanding about
social networking, a project leader can also take advantage of his small
network via friend-of-friend, who can open the gate to a new social
network-the desired network but cannot be approached in a direct way. The
idea is that, by using connection with people in the same research areas,
project leader can get connected with different R&amp;D centers (other
companies’ R&amp;D centers, government R&amp;D centers…) as well as
excellent researchers. If the connection is established and information
transfer channel is turned on, project leader can get expensive
information, knowledge with nearly zero-price. The case of Jusung
Engineering Company is typical. Jusung wanted to develop their own Cluster
tool controllers but faced difficulties because the R&amp;D absorbed so
much money. But through a connection with a KAIST professor, Jusung took a
huge advantage of excellent R&amp;D centers, human resource at KAIST. With
this very cheap R&amp;D facilities and human resources, the company
successfully develop its own control software. The product saved them 40%
of the total licensing fee they had to pay to Brooks Automation (Ingyu Oh,
2010) Another case can be taken as typical example is Keosan Company.
Keosan CEO with his broad network of scientist around the world, he took
advantage of newest knowledge in developing his company’s Wellxy product, a
water purifier with oxygen enriching function. The product helped his
company earn 20$ million sale outside Korea (Ingyu Oh, 2006) In IT world,
social network is very crucial for companies. Nowadays, social networking
provides young entrepreneurs, who have great passion and skill but no
money, connection with investors. These investors can help young
entrepreneurs with money, technological knowledge, and other social
network. The success of Facebook and other start-up companies in US is a
very reliable evidence for the importance of social capital and social
network. From discussion above I can give three propositions: Proposition
1: Absorptive capacity does not necessarily lead to combinative capacity if
fast learning is emphasized for Organization Learning Proposition 2:
Malleable skills of both technical and marketing with R&amp;D department
can lead to combinatory managerial skills Proposition 3: Social networks
play significant role in Connecting &amp; Development when projects have
tight budget Limitation The limitation of this research is that author does
not have a change to collect data through a series of interviews or group
meetings. As a result, a few data may not be enough to test the
propositions.</p>
