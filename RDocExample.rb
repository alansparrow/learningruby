#== Test of text formatting features
#
#Want to see *bold* or _italic_ text? You can even embed
#+text that looks like code+ by surrounding it with plus
#symbols. Indented code will be automatically formatted:
#
#   * this is a list with three paragraphs in
#     the first item. This is the first paragraph.
#
#     And this is the second paragraph.
#     1. This is an indented, numbered list.
#     2. This is the second item in that list
#
#     This is the third conventional paragraph in the
#     first list item.
#   * This is the second item in the original list
  class MyClass
    def method_name
      puts "test"
    end
  end
